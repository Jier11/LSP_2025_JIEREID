// Design patterns can be incredibly useful—when applied correctly, they improve maintainability,
// readability, and overall developer productivity. However if you don't need flexibility, using 
// a pattern just adds needless layers and complicates things. Applying the Strategy pattern when
// there’s only ever one algorithm creates extra  interfaces, classes, and indirection with no real
// benefit where a simple method call would be clearer and faster.
