// Design patterns can be incredibly useful—when applied correctly, they improve maintainability,
// readability, and overall developer productivity. Using a pattern when you’ll never use its flexibility
// just adds needless layers. For example, applying the Strategy pattern when there’s only ever one
// algorithm creates extra  interfaces, classes, and indirection with no real benefit where a simple
// method call would be clearer and faster.
